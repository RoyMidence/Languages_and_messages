  The App is simple. After you log in you can git the "Greeting" or "Goodbye" buttons to have a toast message pop up for the respective buttons. Additionaly, you can
  enter a valid name and a corresponding city will be displayed according to the name. There are only 2 names, Mateo Lopez which displays the city Boston. And 
  Jane Doe which will give you Farmingdale. The names are cities and states are stored on Firebase. Additionally you can change the phones language to either 
  french or spanish and the apps language should change with it.
